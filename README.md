# Aspiring NeuroAI researcher

#### 👋 Hi! I'm Thuy (she/her). I'm passionate about multidisciplinary approaches to research and the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence for socially beneficial applications.

This page is currently under construction. Stay tuned :)

## Quick Facts
- 🏠 I'm from Hanoi, Vietnam.
- 📍 I'm currently studying at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.
- 🌎 I’ve also lived in Geneva, Stockholm, and Ottawa before finding my way to this lovely city!
- 🎧 I love listening to music and making overly specific playlists.
  
## What I'm Thinking About...
- Using AI to bridge the gaps in science communication and make scientific research more accessible to the public.
- Creating an open-access framework for analyzing brain responses to visual stimuli by decomposing images into a low-dimensional feature space and aligning the stimulus features with a neural feature space.
- Addressing gender disparities in pharmaceuticals, focusing on detecting and analyzing biases to improve drug safety and personalized treatment for women and gender diverse people.
- Democratizing AI ethics literacy and encouraging ethics by design. 
- Establishing a Cognitive Science journal club for undergrads.
- The shortcomings of our educational system, the mislabeling and inaccurate measurement of students' abilities, and the need for a reevaluation of the enduring lecture model that has defined traditional schooling.

Happy to chat more about any of these!
